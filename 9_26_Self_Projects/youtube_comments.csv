My bad for leaking your interview question but uhhhh when will I know if I passed
Artists and programmers really be holding hands staring at the fast approaching nuclear explosion on the horizon
"I think people are a little too hard on CS degrees. I agree that most of what you learn probably isn&#39;t going to be useful on the job, like a lot of the discrete math and algorithms, especially if you&#39;re just going into web dev. But I think the job of a university shouldn&#39;t be to teach you things like git, react, or even web dev in general. It should primarily be focused on teaching you how to think about code, problem solving skills, and how to write maintainable code. And you can teach yourself how to use a tool like git or react on your own pretty easily, but it&#39;s much harder to teach yourself how to think. I got an undergraduate CS degree from Northeastern University and I&#39;m really happy with it. My most important classes taught me how to think and solve problems, and it was the type of thing I&#39;d never learn or develop on my own, even though I already had years of coding experience before starting college. From what I&#39;ve heard, most colleges aren&#39;t like that though.<br><br>I think algorithms, os, discrete math, etc. is good to know and enables you to a wider variety of things than just frontend web dev, but I agree that it seems a bit overdone in most colleges. But whenever you&#39;re trying to teach a wide variety of people who might have very different goals, there&#39;s always going to be some things you learn that you don&#39;t end up needing.<br><br>That all being said, it seems colleges might be getting worse than they are now. Northeastern at least seems to be giving in to students complaining about material being too hard and dumbing things down and shifting focus away from how to think, which is sad to see. I still think a degree is the best way to develop the skills to obtain and succeed in a career in tech, but not all jobs should require it. Especially frontend-only jobs. But for an engineer, I&#39;d definitely recommend it if you don&#39;t want to be restricted by not being well-rounded and having a background that enables you to do other things, and you can afford the time and money spent pursuing a degree."
"lol F that, I’m doing accounting."
I just completed a 4 year degree in networks and cloud infrastructure this year so basically all systems type stuff server infrastructures and what not.<br>Just after landing a job that ill be starting in a few weeks.
Software engineering was the degree compsci kids actually wanted but didn’t realize
"Breaking into the tech industry has ALWAYS been difficult. Nobody wants to hire an unproven graduate and the companies that do hire unproven recent uni or code school grads are suspect. They&#39;re probably either chaotic or crap. I have interviewed a lot of jrs and have only ever considered hiring CS grad. I have zero interest working with the self taught lone wolf with everything to prove. I hate working with that guy, I don&#39;t care how talented they are. The degree doesn&#39;t tell me you know how to code, I can figure that out by talking to you about a complex problem pretty easily, the degree tells me you can stick with something and successfully navigate a social organization... and build what you&#39;re told... which is 90% of professional development. Hiring seniors though? I don&#39;t even pay attention to the degree."
"From experience: no it isn&#39;t. I wasted 4 yrs.<br><br>As you said, passion from kindergarten on sells better."
"At this point, if your post high school education doesn&#39;t give you an official accredited certification that is required to work in a particular field, then it&#39;s probably a waste of time and money."
"It&#39;s not that &#39;everyone is self-taught&#39; there&#39;s a big difference. I tried an AEC in server administration and cybersecurity, but every teacher I had agreed it was pointless for me because I already knew as much, if not more, than they did in their fields. I&#39;m self-taught because I spend 9+ hours a day, over 10 years, learning for fun. You can’t compare that to people who sit in a classroom for 5 hours a day, over 14 months, because they need structure to learn, they only learn what&#39;s in the program, a real self-taught person will learn that and everything around it. The real problem is that the system is broken, without that paper, it’s hard to prove my skills. Now I’m starting the attestation process, which will still take 14 months, but at least I won’t have to sit through classes where I know more than the teacher. There&#39;s only so many times you can correct the teacher before it just gets uncomfortable."
"Only jobs that really need higher education are medical or law type degrees. All this Criminal Justice, Social Work, Philosophy, etc. don’t need degrees, they just help with learning some background, but the real job has to be learned on the job"
"Im going for a PhD, and i think its easier and more interesting study for it than studying leetcode to enter faangs"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=270"">4:30</a> I would hire either the furry or the trans woman, bonus if its a trans furry, and then fire the rest of my staff."
Watched the whole video and still don&#39;t know does it worth it or not. 🙃
I’m in IT bachelor program bc I can’t code. Why am I watching this
Got a bachelors in biology only to find out that all related jobs just require a 10 month training certificate and like 2 years of experience.
I do Cyber Security at Google and I never went to college.
Many degrees now are just a stepping stone into grad school. Just make sure you have a plan as to what you intend to do well beforehand and go from there.
I think the importance in collage is truly the experience and getting to meet people and work beside them rather than binge watch youtube from your mom’s closet for a year. Plus the interships and other stuff 😂
Yes. Next question.
Is general psych fine
"This is a complete and utter bullshit. You have all these idiots who go for the same jobs at the same companies(FANNG) then complain about how there are no jobs. Like WTF are you doing, this is how you lose all your leverage. There are plenty of jobs in different industries, oh and if you went to a university, you have something called an alumni network that should have you set up with a job before you even enter your senior year. I&#39;m not sure why people are pushing this narrative, but they could not be more misguided. At this moment I have 10 different financial institutions that are pursuing me and I&#39;m not even a top tier student. I have a  3.1 gpa and my university is a state school, there is absolutely no reason people should be breaking their backs to get into those five companies when there is so much money all around. wake the fuck up you took logic classes right? follow the path of least resistance, cause if you can&#39;t get a job with a CS degree then you should just put fries in the bag because education is wasted on you."
"Don&#39;t get any degrees, unless you want to be a doctor. Learn a trade instead."
Short Answer: Yes
"Completely agree with bad teachers ruining programs. I signed myself up for a 5 figure program (low low 5 figures) and the first day of class, I found myself confused and frustrated. <br><br>I know what a for loop is, but this professor was explaining it as a metaphor with green managers assigning work to blue managers who assign work to red managers that assign work to yellow managers who then assign work to some worker. And this was with a heavy accent so I had to use twice as much mental energy trying to figure out what the professor was saying! It would&#39;ve just been easier to explain what a for loop is..... I was so exhausted by the end of the 90 minute class, I had to go take a nap. I went to a few more sessions but ultimately decided to withdraw after experiencing the same thing each time."
I work in aerospace manufacturing and they will pay for college as long as if i get a degree related in the field. I&#39;m passionate about nothing i just want to make a lot of money. Am i looking in the wrong place or what?
"My friend with a CS degree was laid off 4 months ago, could not land a new job and decided to just go back to school for an MBA, it’s tough out there for Tech right now"
Abdul Bari really was the goat. I&#39;d fail ds without him
"From a grad &quot;reving up those fryers&quot; there is no point comparing self-study/degree. You need both. I dont code as my hobby, i studied it, got a good grade, then got no job, cuz every god damn interview wants my portfolio i do in my free time, apparently stuff i did for uni does not count. :)"
"Don&#39;t you guys have practical degrees? Over here, we&#39;ve got degrees that are taught with the explicit purpose of giving you a degree while actually practically preparing you"
"I got a degree. It was a complete waste of time.  I would not get one again if I could talk to 17 year old me again. In my experience so far having worked 3 jobs as a &quot;Software Engineer&quot; now, its pointless to apply for a job. You have to know someone. If you dont, you wont get a job. If the company you want to work as has an HR departement, you will not get a job there. (Those places tend to suck anyways). The places ive gotten jobs at were places with a really flat hirachy of maybe 1 or 2 levels. The first job I got was at a small ish Team that could hire completely independently but was part of a much much bigger company. The reason why I got this job was literally because someone who was in this team was impressed with me beeing able to edit java bytecode with a byteocde editor to fix bugs in minecraft mods. Overall the work was pretty chill but the pay was bad and the company politics were horrible because even tho the team was completely independent in the engineering parts we still suffered under terrible policies like shared desk, bad food, no oportunity to ever get a raise and the pay was not that good either but for a first job it was very good. The next job I got from talking to some guy while we were both completly drunk in an Irish Pub that offered me a job to make printer drivers. Because it payed like twice of my first job I took the offer. That job was really cool they had 50 software devs working and like no management. Crunch time was also kinda fun because it was an &quot;all inclusive&quot; kinda deal, they got us food and everything was free. (only during crunch time tho, but you could refuse and just go home if you didnt want to) It was the dream and the pay was okay. I only moved to my third and current job because it payed 3x as much as the second job. I got this by a random discord call from someone id worked with on the first job. My current job is challenging, because the majority of the team members are counting days till retirement and a extremely unmotivated... At least it pays very well and yeah once again a company with &quot;almost&quot; no HR and like only 2 layers of management. In my current job every software Engineer reports to the CTO and the CTO reports to the &quot;Owner&quot;/Boss and there is also a decently sized sales department that we dont interact with a lot tho. Team size is 10-12 devs (some are part time)."
Even basic ass tech support jobs are requiring a bachelors in CS these days.
"In hardware engineering it’s kind of the same deal. Like getting the EE degree helps a bunch, but proving you can take a design from concept to working PCB is incredibly important. I got some background in theory and circuit design in school, but reading datasheets, learning manufacturing limits, accounting for tolerances, PCB design, etc. were topics I had to train myself to do."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=34"">0:34</a> I couldn&#39;t agree more <br>Not just in programing but any thing"
"Lol, there are plenty of jobs out there. But people only want those 150k Google jobs."
Even in Data Analyst roles. Shit loads of case interviews and multiple rounds. I fucking hate it
In the job for a bit more than two years now but i dont like it since i have to speak to customers who sometimes dont even know how to start a computer... so how are they going to explain their problem properly? <br>Yea I dont know man
No bro
Major in electrical engineering
Having a degree just shows how deeply a person has invested their time and money into a business model for a certificate.  It&#39;s similar to how cattle ranchers brand their stock
I work in support and earning that sweet tech money. Part of the problem no one mentions is that there&#39;s more to it than just being a Dev / coder / Engineer. <br><br>There&#39;s also other more accessible roles that need the same skill set like Support / QA /  Product Management / Customer Success / Networking / which are just as important as engineering. Yes you still need to know how to read and write code.
"so Software Engineering or CS? <br><br>tbh I love Tech and stuff, but at the same time, i need that bread."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=838"">13:58</a><br>&quot;..i kinda want to have a conversation about it with you cuz i like you and you are smart&quot;<br>I&#39;d leave FAANG immediately if i had to interact with a person like that. 😅"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=356"">5:56</a> Where you got the degree matters greatly. The joke at my college was always:<br>A: You went to Cal Poly? That&#39;s a great school, Nice! <br>B: Pomona<br>A: Oh"
I have a computer science degree and I regret not doing electrical engineering instead
"I&#39;m an art major watching this video. I&#39;m exponentially more fucked, but I just wanted to see how you guys are doing, too. We&#39;re in this together."
"main benefit of college was to be forced to do math, it helped long term"
bro rlly said standing next to another man is gay lmao
you’re suppose to “cheat”
I like this video in that it validates me that I never learnt how to code
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=305"">5:05</a><br><br>mr krabssssss i have an ideaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
"Nice video man, I subscribed!"
I&#39;m so glad I went into the trades haha.
I do NOT regret my CS degree. I had to work with concepts such as DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) and ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) when modelling novel business logic or when simply working with a CSS preprocessor. You need to know what is out there to later understand the possibilities you have ahead of you.
"The problem is all these entitled comp sci kids who keep posting doomer videos about how “tech is cooked” just because they couldn’t get a job at one of the 4 big tech companies they applied for. NEWS FLASH developers are needed everywhere and jobs are a plenty. But you shouldn’t be expecting to get a big tech job paying $200k+ a year straight out of college. New grads needed to get humbled and realize they will need to do their time in the industry for a couple years before they can realistically expect to get a job that pays the big bucks. Especially if you didn’t put any effort into getting internships or posting a few side projects on github during university. The degree is just a checkbox, but your experience and real application of your skills is what gets you the job"
why would they hire an american with a degree when they can hire someone from 3rd world india with the same degree who will work for less?
"I don’t know why I’m watching this. I’m 30, life is over."
makes me sad because I&#39;m studying CS and I genuinely love it :(
Graduated with a cs major and an info systems minor. Couldn’t even get a job at Wendy’s luckily I got a starting position in IT and am hoping to get my foot in the door at some point. My guess is it’s more about who you know than what you know. From what I’ve heard bootcamps are the best route as opposed to just trying to raw dog it.
answer: No
"Yeah, Im a freelancer,  I used to see a bunch of upwork jobs that were clearly universitu students trying to have a developer do their exercise for them."
"College degrees should be to follow an interest, learn more, and get a foot in the door. (For the most part)  most things can be self taught, and even if you are not, you will need to self teach to keep up with changing technology"
Use your CSCI knowledge to reach out to other industries.
A degree is pretty important.  Would you be comfortable with your doctor not having a medical degree if degrees aren&#39;t worth that much to you?
"Even when it was hot in the 2010s you had to do personal project or have a referral to get an interview. Not to sound boomer bc it is harder today, but i think it’s being blown out of proportion by applicants who would have struggled somewhat back then too… but I’ve rode my job through this wave so i don’t really know"
NO! <br>(windows shatter)
"Man im not even joking, i graduated may 2023 with a cs bachelors and i still havent been able to get a cs/tech job, it fucking sucks out here. I just wanna use my degree 😭😭<br>The debate to go back to school for a masters that i dotn even care about just to get an entry level job is tempting."
"Got Master&#39;s degree in Computer science here. Nah, it&#39;s not worth it. There&#39;s nothing I can do what a person with a bootcamp or a diploma cannot."
"Man, this actually makin me thankful my professor is an asshole and teaches us how to climb the corporate ladder, marketing, critical thinking, the whole nine yards. Honestly didn&#39;t realize the world was in such a shit spot in the computer world."
"I&#39;ve considered so many STEM degrees, but I decided to pursue a nursing degree because of it&#39;s security."
"The problem is that people think that bachelor CS degree is for coding. It is not. They know how code sure, but that is not the objective of CS."
"Screw college, become furry inflation artist"
"The industry sucks right now, especially for entry level guys. Good luck."
Is (u(kjak spam still thoughtless?
Is Computer Science still worth it? <br>Short answer: NO
"yeah but its undeniably easier to just. NOT do computer science. And just. Try less and get paid more doing literally anything other than maintaining demon portals so that ads can come through. Theres no real payoff to being or TRYING TO BECOME some IT hirers idea of &quot;really passionate IT person&quot; why? So I can ride that razors edge between having a personality and Young Sheldon for an extra 2 dollars an hour?. So my boss has a better vehicle to push ads through? why does IT DESERVE to harvest this passion but not CULTIVATE it? There is no reason. I wish people would stop moping when faced with the prospect their degree is useless, and be happy to learn something non demon-rune related for once. Like Carpentry... or Plumbing."
Is life still worth it
Going to university and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to just be &quot;well rounded&quot; is retarded. You have a better chace of taking that money and opening a business to be more succesful.
a portfolio guys degrees are mid now in every field
The only interview question that matters: &quot;tabs or spaces?&quot; This one question cuts to the heart of programming.
i want tell you. now times 2020s worst time we are living right now. i wish we are in 2000s and 2010s. Because covid ruined everythings.
"Very much so is useful. I currently hold a 170k a year job with it. So tired of the nonsense of degrees being worthless, there not, people just don’t know how to leverage them. Many industries are willing to train you from the ground up if you have a 2 or 4 year degree in anything because it shows your baseline intelligence. If your broke with a 4 year degree look into insurance adjusting, they will train you from the ground up and starting salaries are at 70k and you get issued a company vehicle. The work isn’t hard, mostly work from home, switch companies every 2 years and you will be at 80 to 110k a year doing that work. Put a little effort into what your degree qualifies you for and if you didn’t look up jobs before choosing your your major that’s on you."
"I got the foobar challenge a few years ago while browsing.. learned computer science enough to pass it, then was flown by google to mountain view to interview. Failed the interview when they wanted me to remember syntax. Then they fired the whole team last year. Its the syntax that doesnt matter."
All this &quot;CS is done for&quot; really feels like copium coming from other professions
"I dont know any broke or unemployed computer scientists. Maybe that&#39;s because I&#39;m 43 and live in DC. If you want $150k a year, get a comp sci degree, move to dc and apply to 3 letter agencies"
"Wish someone at college would have told me how much more work you HAVE to do in preparing for jobs once you’re out, at least for these jobs.<br><br>You would have cut out so much slack of people who could have found something so much more fulfilling for that time.<br><br>Fuck."
Starting with my CS classes in a week and I&#39;m terrified ngl
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=1203"">20:03</a>.<br>Bro! Your not even subscribed."
"If you aren&#39;t passionate about it and don&#39;t think you really have the natural talent but you think it will get you somewhere or you will make lot&#39;s of money if you get into Computer Science or Software Engineering, ohhh YOU ARE SOOO WRONG! If you want to make a good money then go with the mechanical or construction route, if you want to be something and earn some decent money then go with the farming and agriculture route. If I were to be young today and found myself of making career decision today, I would definitely pick one of these. Because demand is high on this jobs today and because of demand is high, they offer good money in return. And it seems it will be high for a long time because no one wants to work in these necessary jobs and everyone wants to work in IT or become a YouTuber or Streamer nowadays. Even the numbers of people who want to be doctor or lawyer are low nowadays. People don&#39;t want to work hard yet get rich in the easy way.<br><br>The mechanical and construction routes will make you a good money in short time, this way you may have your own place or land or maybe open up a small local business or you can work in those jobs for as long as you want and save up lots of money for the future interests such retirement or heritage on your children. <br>The farming and agriculture route will make you a good money in the long run but you will have your own farm or dairy or both and you will live a mostly peaceful life out of city, you can heritage your farm on your children also.<br><br>But the real advice I can give you is that; don&#39;t try to be something that you don&#39;t have passion and natural talent for it, because it won&#39;t make you rich neither you will be happy and content doing that job. So do you and pick your way that suits you. Even if you won&#39;t get rich at least you will be content and happy in your job and this is the way most people righteously got rich in business by the way. There is no easy way except stealing or having some other shady ways and I DON&#39;T RECOMMEND THAT."
Im still waiting for all the viral video of people with CS and Masters degrees cry on camera about them not being hired.
"imho is it really self taught when you do youtube and udemy courses?<br>btw yo ucan selflearn design patterns - <br>all and all you are using language, you are building on already acquired knowledge, you need some external source"
"I remember in 2019 I took an introduction class for beginners and every single person there, knew how to code so well already. That’s when I realized market was over saturated."
answer is no

"I think STEM, more specifically, computer science and engineering will see a massive fall off of employee&#39;s and plummet into what it once was pre-covid. Reaching the end of my software development degree, it was VERY easy to tell nearly 95% of people you run into in the tech industry are solely and purely there for the salary or hourly pay. Nothing more and nothing less. They hardly put in the time to do anything when it comes to any sort of &quot;coding&quot;, float by off of AI code generators, some self knowledge, but mainly charisma. A LOT and I mean A LOT of people within the tech industry can sell themselves as some noble winning, freedom thought thinker than can code full fledge enterprise application like a Netflix or Spotify. When in reality, they couldn&#39;t even code you a very simple console based game without pulling the vast majority of the code from the internet. Do not get me wrong, the industry is chalk full of highly qualified and skilled individuals who if given the time, could replicate apps like Netflix, Facebook, X, or anything in between with minimal help. The big difference though is those are the one&#39;s who truly love this area, love complex problems and finding dynamic ways to solve problems. There love for coding expands beyond their respective IDE. It is intertwined in their daily life. They do not see it as a simple desk job you show up for, put in minimal effort, code, then move on to the next company to try and negotiate for a higher salary. They see it as a way of life. You are already starting to see it now with many CovidTech-19 kids who are 18 - 30, see they can make 6 figure salaries as an entry level software engineer, put in minimal effort and pull every string they can get just to land an &quot;entry&quot; level job. Only for them to hate it. Which then leads to the plethora of articles coming out that states many people within the tech industry as a whole absolutely hate their job. Many highly motivated individuals who are looking to further themselves and their career are getting overlooked by college graduates who know how to utilize AI correctly, can have AI tailor make resumes and cover letters, pull every string they have by calling tim, sally, and jerry, and begging for a recommendation. Only to find out by day 3 they hate sitting at a desk all day looking at a computer screen. 10/10 jobs you work for are not Google or some top FAANG company that liters YouTube with day in the life as a software engineer at said FAANG company. ALL of those videos promise nothing but false hope. Anyone looking to break into this area, just know the vast majority of your career will be in some office, sitting all day on sub optimal computer equipment and that&#39;s quite literally it. You are not going to have lavish lunches paid for every single day, there isn&#39;t relax stations or break areas with PS5&#39;s, Xboxs, or anything like that. I can definitely see in 5+ years, this industry having a complete wash and regressing back to what it once was. An area that is small but dominated by highly skilled individuals who are passionate and excited about more than a salary. Just wait for all of these covidiots (which most have) to hit the inevitable wall that is burnout and quickly switch paths onto what they see as an easy way to make money. Coding, software engineering, development, and computer science as a whole is NOT easy. It is easy when all you do is simply CTRL C + CTRL V into ChatGPT. Which is what most people are doing. Moving on to the topic of education within Computer Science. That is completely dependent on the person and the style in which they like to learn. I heavily prefer a guided course in which we have weekly get-togethers and coding activities only come out on a weekly basis. Not only that, I like to have a mentor that I can fall back on and ask questions. Some can simply load up YouTube, treat YouTube as a university and completely thrive and flourish that way. It all boils down to preference of learning. If you prefer a grounded type of learning, do not force yourself to sit and watch youtube videos with little guidance to help reinforce key learning topics. You&#39;ll just be left with more questions than answers. Vice versa as well. When it comes to the individual who wants a grounded or guided experience without having to pay like myself, there are many platforms who offer free, guided learning. Coursera provides certifications and is a great way to learn with someone who has little to no money. I earned 3 certifications and have yet to pay for a single dollar. If you are smart, you can take advantage of the free 7-day trial. Throw in a card to a bank account that has $0 and you will still get the subscription. Coursera does not do any sort of test charge to verify money is within account. Do with that as you please, but you can earn multiple certs on that platform with the cost of $0. I do not think CS will be useless, however many of the people who decided to pursue CS in the timespan of Covid think it is useless because they cannot pump and dump this area like its some sort of cryptocurrency. CS degree != 100k salary. If you cannot figure out what I just said in that last sentence without any sort of internet help and have been studying CS since 2020, that should be your first sign CS ain&#39;t for you."
"The only job 99% of CS going to get is being a full stack + sys admin + network for $45-50k a year. You could cheat the system and move to Indian tho, that&#39;s where most of the jobs haven&#39;t been AI automated are out sourced to."
I fell for meme guys.
Tl:DR = yes now and forever 😂
I have a B.S. in Computer Science and now I bartend for a living
What route should I take if “college is a scam” is there any certification or course I could take to get my foot in the door?
I got a 4 year degree in cyber security and it was 100% worth it. I was lucky enough to get picked up for an internship at a cybersecurity firm and my career toke off. If I didn&#39;t land that internship I don&#39;t know how my career would have went. I&#39;ve been working in the field for 6 years.
"jokes on you, fast food jobs are impossible to get also. Jokes aside I&#39;m also super passionate about programming and CS, and studying it in college. I&#39;ve never taken it very far through high school, mostly just making games with c# but I love everything about it. I&#39;m the opposite of you, I hate grinding leetcode problems and building a server rack out of raw copper. I like making games and stuff but am willing to get my hands dirty for a job/degree. Hope chatgpt doesn&#39;t nail me to a cross in 3 years."
As someone who went for the Veteran path to SRE/SWE. There are a lot of paths open. I would suggest going for at least a secret security clearance though. It&#39;s a lot easier to get your foot in the door as a System Administrator in a government agency.
"I&#39;m studying mechanical engineering. Sure, we get to play with 3D printers but other than that, I could learn everything at the library. It&#39;s not like college professors are as involved in teaching you as they were in high school. I&#39;ve actually been struggling a lot with this degree due to some mental health issues and I&#39;m passively considering pivoting to something easier. I don&#39;t feel like I was built for this hypercompetitive stuff. I just want to sit at an office and design stuff. I see people complaining about becoming &quot;CAD slaves&quot; but it really doesn&#39;t seem that bad to me."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=453"">7:33</a> This is the issue though, yes Computer Science =/= Software Engineering but having that Computer Science background, actually understanding the theory and how it applies to what you&#39;re doing as a SWE in FAANG, will 100% set you apart from other candidates. Not just applying the Theorems, but what is means and implies. - From a person who is graduating this year in Theoretical Math and has a fulltime offer from FAANAG and my last internship with the same company was just straight up Graph Theory applications."
"At the end of the day, we’re all trying to make some money, and if the heartache, time, money, and effort outweighs the pros, is it even worth it?"
"Ive got 6-10 HR connections a week as 5 year self tought (with BA in business and unfinished MA in Urban planning). Work as DS. Where is no jobs, dudes?"
Recruiting team is not technical but they filter applicants so the system is a little unfair. Fortunately I worked at 3 Fortune 500s in the past 5 years and graduated with a bachelors and masters degree in computer science so I don’t have to worry as much. However I did notice that even for roles that I was perfectly qualified roles it’s possible they simply don’t scan through your application for reasons out of your control
"We just need better human resources, they got too damn lazy and started to just rely on a degree instead of assessing someone&#39;s skill set."
just wait 10 years bro
"We had professors reading down from the ppt, which we all already had. Extremely useful class, because we developed a game from  it, cuz the dude had a little bit of OCD and you could &quot;predict&quot; or &quot;bet&quot; on what he will do next."
"I studied CS and it took me 10 years to get my 4 year degrees (life stuff happened). Around my senior year, I realized that i dont like programming unless its web dev because im a very creative/visual person. Fast forward, i work IT at a top university in the nation (I honestly forget because its a university and I think all of them are scams) and I did some interviews for my assistant position. A BUNCH of CS majors with bachelors degrees trying to get in and i was pretty shocked. I will say, a lot of it depended on if they were a good fit for our department and most really couldn&#39;t interview well. You also gotta remember that you are competing with international students as well."
abdul is goated 😭😭
"A couple years ago I would have said CS degree is useless and you should just go bootcamp/self taught path. In fact I was about to do that but opted for CS degree since I was dumb and lazy, couldn&#39;t do anything without guidance.<br><br>Looking at it now, having the degree is probably a requirement just because supply of devs is much higher than demand. There&#39;s just so many applicants for every role that now more than ever employers are probably just using the easiest filter of them all: CS degree."
"I would like to add, this is a country to country question. Some countries if you have the slightest knowledge with IT they will hire you instantly. Meanwhile some places it&#39;s impossible to get a job with the best degrees and experience."
No
"In a hypothetical where the answer is objectively &quot;No, it&#39;s worthless&quot;, would these sorts of videos be any different than what they are now?<br><br>The question is posed because of a strong industry-wide trend. It&#39;s not best answered by what&#39;s good career advice on any Tuesday. The context-aware assessment is pretty dire. Economists will tell you that it&#39;s unfortunate how so many of the SEs fired from big tech aren&#39;t requalifying to other disciplines to take advantage of the low unemployment rates in other sectors. I.e. if we go by what was sensible every time this happened in other industries, the people with what was top tier experience yesterday will fair better if they gtfo.<br><br>This has been my experience. I have a very slick 3 yoe resume in one of the better subdomains and at this point I&#39;m kinda done. I went to a number of last rounds of interview over months, and each and every single one ended with &quot;very good impression, but we&#39;ve decided to go with a more experienced candidate&quot;. My career gap grows as tens of thousands of more experienced SEs keep getting injected into the job market. I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;ve seen any posting for out of college juniors here. I really can&#39;t recommend a 0 yoe version of my current position to anyone.<br><br>Shareholders were promised growth at peak COVID and bought high. It&#39;s now obvious tech companies have no means of reaching the numbers they had back then. But there&#39;s another way to increase revenues, and it has never been exploited in big tech. The era of cutting costs has begun. Any insider with basic understanding of non-SE industry knows the amount of inefficiency we&#39;ve accumulated that&#39;s now begging to be cut is insane. The $500k salaries for being a less serious engineer than cousins from E/M were never going to be there forever. Basically-inevitable growth allowed us to overstay. Who the hell is actually gonna ever challenge the locked in monopolies of big tech any time soon? They don&#39;t have any justification to say no when shareholders tell them to cut, it&#39;s the world&#39;s biggest cash cow.<br><br>IMO, so long as we remain in the highest unemployment rate of any sector, so long as big tech keeps shedding headcount, if you care about not withering away as unskilled labour for the rest of your life, you should study something else."
"if you are applying to govn&#39;t jobs, even associate&#39;s degrees are not enough. you MUST have a cs degree so you can be an IT."
"Bruh i wrote a stupid round robin scheuler, stupid but i did it applying the theory, and i&#39;m self taught so stop trying to paint a view on how self taught people are less scientific."
AI Assistants are great when you know for sure the solution already exists somewhere on github.<br>Because then you just slap the assistant until it delivers it to you.
"I agree with him, i see CS degree in university, is that they teach the fundamental of how computer and algorithms etc works. Also you learn to code in a way so other can read your code in a team environment. Because lets be honest, it is always hard to understand someone else&#39;s code let alone your own. And you make connections along the way because they could be your references when you start looking for a job. But university for me are an important stepping stone for research job."
Gang should I just change my major to Finance like my bro suggested or stick with CS
"My biggest regret in life? Going to college for my parents. My degree was all for nothing and I never cared for it. Unless you&#39;re willing to do everything this man says in the video, move away from your parents and even cut off communication for a bit if you must. Don&#39;t make the mistake I did. I am underemployed and questioning why I even bother. I could&#39;ve used that time to save money instead.<br><br>I am depressed on a daily basis and absolutely loathed college in the first place. Don&#39;t go to this field unless you absolutely want it and are willing to devote your life to it like a religion."
"The biggest issue is the hordes of third worlders swarming any European nation to be let itn., They shouldn&#39;t even be here."
the problem with college is that its not meant to teach you. its meant to have a professional who already knows how things work to confirm if you&#39;re correct or not. a knowledge check audit perse.
"If you want to get into software development, you should learn Computer Science principals.  That does NOT mean get a degree (although one helps). Learn the principals, focus on one language, get a &quot;foot in the door&quot; job, work your ass off to learn as much as you can for 2-3 years, then you will start progressing.  The key, NEVER STOP LEARNING.  Tech is always changing, and not always for the best.  Learn the principals, put in yoru time, you will do well.<br><br>There is ALWAYS a need.  I do not have faith in AI replacing developers.  Assisting, maybe, but not flat out replacing."
"I&#39;m in the middle of my CS degree. I&#39;m mostly getting it to make myself look better to employers, but I know I could learn it all on my own if I wanted to; I&#39;m already pretty good at learning things on my own. I like videos like this because they remind me of what I&#39;m getting into. I have a lot of work to do..."
"Tech Jobs have been marketed to be those comfy cushion six figure jobs for the last 20 years, this is why millions of People are entering College to graduate with a Comp Sci degree, only to realize that these comfy cushion jobs no longer exist, competition is fierce, six figures is a pipe dream for many now, and the Tech Industry is highly volatile, one moment everyone is hiring, the next moment everyone is firing. <br>I&#39;d rather spend that College Money on a Medical Degree, or another Engineering Degree, or Law, or Finance Degree, a Computer Science degree in 2024 is useless if that&#39;s the only Career option you want to pursue. This is a very unstable Career, almost every Software Engineer has faced a layoff in their career, and everyone is always looking to jump jobs every 3 to 4 years."
Why is CASEOH in the line 😭😭
"I kind of did it the other way around. I got my foot in the door while I was in school, so by the time I didn&#39;t graduate I already had a portfolio started."
"In the 4 ctegories. I am who I am. Sometimes, I am which I am, and sometimes, I am that I am."
Their is one more thing i like to add every cs or degree holder know they wasted 80% of time doing degree but college also give opportunity to explore different domain which you might never seen before
Oh tech jobs will always be around. Even the hardware resources AI that would resolve technical issues have to break down sometime
"I took an unconventional route but my way in was just working in IT and getting my degree and certs paid for by a company. BS in Cloud Computing MS in Software Engineering. I think you should just over-specialize and have an IT day-job to learn how computing works through experience and certifications.<br><br> (also having money and my own apartment was pretty gangster compared to being a broke college kid) Not to mention all of my cloud certifications helped me in IT infrastructure and in becoming a programmer and at age 22 I had 4 years of job experience and my bachelors degree which gave me a much higher salary than someone also my age.  <br><br><br>Computer science for me would have been a waste of time because I already knew a lot about computers from just being a huge nerd and watching videos about computers, software and hardware growing up (also my path involved the least amount of math possible until I did algorithms during the masters).<br><br>I think being a software/cloud engineer is more skills than knowledge too especially when all your knowledge is written somewhere on google/chatgpt. You should really just work on putting things into practice than memorization like a trades person. (grinding leetcode, deploying azure/terraform etc)"
"No, its not, stop pushing and accept facts"
"If Kendrick was the recruiter, we know who he would pick between certified, college graduate, or self taught."

"I have a Master&#39;s degree in software engineering (bachelor in plain old computer science) and started working a bit over 5 years ago. It&#39;s absolutely true that getting your foot in the industry is the most important bit and honestly I wouldn&#39;t even think about going to Google, Meta and Co for your first job, unless maybe you are an absolute prodigy - it&#39;s just not worth it imo, especially if you have to move into cities with high costs of living. Personally, I didn&#39;t even move out in the beginning, now I already own a very nice apartment my friends in the cities are jealous of.<br>Even at smaller companies your starting salary should be pretty decent and pay should go up very fast too. For instance, I now earn about 50% more (after adjusting for inflation) compared to just 5 years ago.<br>But I&#39;d absolutely recommend getting a proper degree and completely agree with the original video. You still have to learn everything yourself (obviously) and especially with programming you&#39;ll need to practice a lot outside college courses but it will definitely affect your salary and position/role throughout your entire career.<br><br>AI will also most likely not push you out of the job market for at least a decade I think, if ever. There is SOOO much more to successfully executing a software project than writing code and even this doesn&#39;t work that well in practice yet. Plus, I think generatative AI will soon hit some really hard limits as to how well it can perform tasks. I&#39;ll be worried about my job when clients know what they actually precisely want on a technical level and even then, do you really trust the finished software to be bug-free and do exactly what you want it to do without knowing how to code and being able to verify?"
"If CS degrees are useless, then I guess my stats degree is even more useless"
"A degree might not be for you. But it&#39;s definitely not useless in society. <br><br>Any person might be able to &quot;self learn&quot; all of the material in college, the issue is, very few would probably know exactly what to learn and how valuable those things are, or balance it properly. On top of that, most average people are not particularly good at self-learning on free wheels. The average person needs some tracks laid ahead of them, and on top of that, there is some kind of guarantee when you step out, that the university signs off on the fact that this person has been introduced to a certain set of information, and been able to do well enough at it to pass the exams/projects, that the jobs can feel some comfort in trying them out.<br><br>But if someone just looks up &quot;random&quot; shit on youtube, and builds a couple of projects, while they might know a bit about coding in a single language or two, and know the basics, do we truly expect them to suddenly pick up discrete mathematics and put in 3 months of effort into understanding prop logic, and mathematical proofs? Or do deep dives for 4 months into the inner workings of OS?<br><br>The strength of computer scientists, are to have that deeper, more well-rounded knowledge, to tackle more difficult problems that may arise, which doesn&#39;t have a simple stackoverflow copy/paste solution laid out for them."
You left out the next option which is someone with certifications like CCNA or something. I am in that boat along with some internships and years of low end experience. Still working on cars though.
"The guy who made that video that you reviewed is a normie. Who the hell does not like automata, discrete math! What an idiot. These code monkeys are the ones losing jobs, and I say well deserved and that is fine."
"It still worth it, but only for documents. At home I learned about coding much more than in my IT college."
nah college is a scam im doing 2 yrs of the elective bs and required general studies before i actually work on my main degree its cringe
that data doesnt say wht degree though what if there isa good chunk with unrelated degrees
"Want a stable, very well-paying job? Do medical school :)"
"I dropped Computer Science Course to Math.<br>I started in 2019 due to the technology hype, but, in the end, I noticed I just love Math. Want to be a teacher, even with the current bad conditions in basic education.<br>I liked some things in Computer Science like Discrete Math, Automata Theory, Algorithm, but I just didn&#39;t like working on a computer coding doing websites, game, managing data base etc. <br>After anxiety and depression first experience, I decided to change to what I love in 2023, even when society just look at education with bad eyes. I just couldn&#39;t continue 2 more years to finish CS.<br><br>I think CS is a wonderful course, but not the absolute best because it doesn&#39;t exist."

Does my uncle being the CEO count as well? 😂
TLDR you are cooked.
They are but even if you are a comp sci grad you still have to self teach programming. Only programming makes you a better programming.
I’m selftaught and almost finishing my first app🎉
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=969"">16:09</a> It&#39;s cool that in Brazil we have technology degrees that we call &quot;Tecnólogo&quot;, which are basically self-contained college degrees focused on providing you with a well-rounded education, plus teaching you the technologies that the market uses. My Systems Analysis and Development degree (Análise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas) had 2 DSA classes, operating systems, computer architecture (we got to play around with Assembly a bit), and some math and statistics. Meanwhile, we also learned modern subjects, like a class dedicated to mobile development with native tools and React Native, simple DevOps with AWS, CI/CD, back-end and front-end web development, OO, etc. The degree duration is exactly 3 years, though there are some that last 2.5 years (2 years and 1 semester)."
"College should be a place of higher education, not job training."
"Glad I changed my mind last minute when choosing what degree I wanted. Spent months preparing for computer science, telling everyone I was going in that. Then when it came time to actually sign up to college... I selected Industrial Electronics instead because that frankly sounded a lot more interesting. I don&#39;t regret my choice now that AI is coming in to steal these jobs. Mine is perfectly safe until AI can work on stuff in the physical world."
"No, there saved you 20 minutes of your life. Possibly years"
"I&#39;m just glad that I have a job for after college lined up. I got lucky in that a good friend of mine got an internship at a company that mainly hires through recommendations, and he worked there long enough for me to use him as a recommendation. I wasn&#39;t able to get any interviews outside of that last year. It&#39;s not a company I want to work for longer than I have to, but it gives me valuable experience that I can build up until the market is better and I can start getting other positions in my field."
"I attempted to dual compsci and a media-related degree, but only finished the latter because my school actively made it harder for engineers who have to work through school(multiple 5-day/wk classes but not enough financial aid to no-life that semester). But I still learned to code on both accounts and it&#39;s an utter trashfire out here. I literally had professors go &quot;look up Youtube tutorials&quot; in 2020-21 and &quot;I can&#39;t help you, today&#39;s a work day&quot;. $72k in debt to earn just a bit above the poverty line. My 3D animation teacher, based on the work of her students, should be paying us back with damages."
I agree CS is cooked with ai and chatGPTs like Devin with all the codes
"I believe universities or colleges become a scam when professors truly do not care about the students and think the students are &#39;beneath&#39; them, instead of considering that their teaching methods are either terrible or difficult to understand. This is where the ignorant and arrogant come in to think that the students are a bunch of amateurs who are not worth their time, but their researchs . What is so crazy about this is that we, the students (customers), are paying them to teach and facilitate learning, not to go there, suffer, and be threatened by them. This is something our society really needs to work on to fix these issues."
"It was always like this, even 8 years ago when I started in CS, to now as a SysAdmin.<br><br>Companies don&#39;t want unexperienced goobers and tech people are the first to go when layoffs happen. When the economy is good again. Tech will flourish again."
"In all honesty, my main resource for actually improving my coding was always to read a book on the language first to get a higher level feel of how the language works. I&#39;m studying Mech E, but I&#39;ve had to do projects in C++, VBA, and Matlab and my first go to if I have to really get a feel for the language without just staring at someone else&#39;s code was always some kind of textbook. It doesn&#39;t tell me what to do, but really the concepts and I use them as a reference to look stuff up when I get stuck on a problem (coding or not coding)."
What a waste of a video.
"Interest rates are a dependent variable.  They can go down because economic growth prospects have gone down, or they can go down because the Fed lowered  them to spur higher economic growth."
I mean I don’t have a degree in CS but work with people who do
If coders didnt brag how much money they make with so little effort people wouldnt jump onto the CS wagom that quickly. Good things need gatekeeping if you want them to keep being good 😅
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=200"">3:20</a> interest rates going down? Why should loans be cheaper to get? It&#39;s a complicated economic thing, so many consequences of great magnitude with whatever the decision."
The answer is yes.
"@TheCodingSloth there is no problem with CS degree, the real problem that it&#39;s a commercial degree, basically you are tight to become a commercial programmer. If CS could have less practical but a lot more theoretical like advanced mathematics theory, it could be more sustained in a long run, because technology is constantly changing but mathematical root&#39;s in it - never changes. Mathematical roots in OOP more helpful to be understood when you need to constantly adapt to something new, rather than applied understanding in how to make stuff with OOP. Also applied knowledge makes student&#39;s overconfident, ppl trying to aim to a lot more demanding jobs neglecting a lot of important things around practical work. For example we actually have a lot more jobs for programming like in Machine Engineering, Construction, CAD; rather than in FANG. But anyway new SC degree will be Data Analyst - they are also commercial degree and soon this degree will face the same problems as CS. Also there is new programs in some places Extreme Programming (XP) as a Bachelor Degree, i think this will be a huge success in some small business or B2B niech, probably will be a good competitor with AI outsource, right now i&#39;m not sure what kind of Masters you could obtain after that, but probably you could have SE Masters."
Im really worried for yall who say that youtube taught you more than professors/TAs in school... what kind of crap school you all went to?
Its all so tiresome
The top engineers that have been working for 30-40 years at the government agency I work for make $212k salary. Google software devs with 2 years of experience make $250k. The real question is if anything EXCEPT a computer science degree worth it?
This was an interesting and informative video.  Subscribed.
"Hi NeetCode, I have a lot of respect for you and your content so I just wanted to point out that the whole &quot;suss&quot; thing is a little hurtful and unnecessary. Replace the word &quot;suss&quot; (or &quot;zesty&quot;) with &quot;gay&quot; and suddenly we&#39;re back to an era of homophobic playground insults. It&#39;s no different. Please don&#39;t foster a space that alienates and may be toxic to your LGBT viewers :/ You can do better."
"When these videos appear, that&#39;s usually the bottom signal for the market"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=978"">16:18</a> &quot;courses are not an efficient way to learn&quot;<br>I disagree. People always say that you can just learn everything yourself and maybe faster but the truth is the only people that really do it is the 0.01% of researchers where as kids they competed in competitions because they are just that good (Like Terrence Tao in math or some top CS researchers). I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t but I am saying it&#39;s some kind of fantasy that for 99.99% of people that argue it, it is not applicable to them."
I think I&#39;ll just join the Marines
"Here is the contradiction, AI won&#39;t replace programmers and AI improve programmers productivity. So programmers are more productive, thus less programmers are needed, because some work that used to be done by a programmer is now replaced by the work done by AI. Then how came that AI is not replacing programmers?<br>Can someone explain the logic here?"
"My job dropped all entry level positions, we use AI in our workflow. Even if coding stays around, the salaries are dropping back down to reality. The tech bubble of 2020 is ending. Now everyone wants to be in Cyber Security... which isn&#39;t entry level lol."
"I was v sad sad bad bad when I just graduated and didn&#39;t get a job, and had vv bad wlb at my internship. <br>But now I&#39;m actually in a place where I love being a software engineer. I don&#39;t actually love coding itself, but I love the things that my job enables me to do. <br>You can work hybrid (super great tbh), you get paid a lot(super epicly great), amazing opportunities for making more money, opportunities to contribute in any field you want basically, easily to get into the startup world, you meet great people, and a ton of other benefits. But yes this is all assuming you are able to get a good job."
Software Engineering BSc I know had almost two full years(2/4) of nothing but math and theory described in the video. Are there different kinds of degrees?
"Read &quot;I Quit BlackRock After Slogging My Way to VP in 7 Years&quot;.   This economics grad was hired at BlackRock.   One of her first assignments was to code a program in SQL for data analysis, even though she knew nothing about programming.   She didn&#39;t like her job but the money was really good.   She quit after 7 years and took an 80% pay cut to work at a start-up."
Wtf im some random sysadmin/sysengineer and its all good? D: Though we have a software dev. Turned devops
"Programming is not the only path in CS, you learn Networking and communication networks, computersystems engineering basics, web development, front end development, backend development, mobile application development, Systems development, Operating system management, Low level systems development, database management, database development, APIs, Systems analysis, Informatics, information systems, Data structures and algorithms, Machine learning, robotics basics, all coupled with mathematical background to handle computer based mathematical problems, and many more that i left out<br><br>No self-taught developers can really come out that well equiped after 3-4 years of self teaching and that&#39;s why companies prefer graduates over self taught developers<br><br>In conclusion, it&#39;s 100% still worth it"
"I don&#39;t agree, I&#39;m sure that in coming years are gonna request degree to filter candidates again"
"Got a degree, don’t even use it in my new job. I gave up finding a developer job when everything went south and just got myself a cushy public service job instead"
"There&#39;s another path, the one I took: military in a Intel or Cyber field. NOT IT, has to be intelligence or cyberwarfare. Then a CS degree on top of it. This will get you a 120k job afterwards without ever applying to a job."
I swapped from compsci to another major as a freshman. I am glad I did. The major I swapped to has WAYYYY more job opportunities.
"youtube tutorials have never worked for me, college was the only way I could get knowledge to stick"
"If it truly interests you, sure. Don&#39;t pursue something you don&#39;t even like. Pursue what you love and are good at, find a way to monetize and sell it, even if it has to be a side hustle."
"You got a bad gig. My first software engineering job, my two mentors taught me everything I know and also recommended tons of books. Most of my mentors have now that I think about it"
"Not a CS Major (but thinking about it a lot). But I am finishing a major right now, and I&#39;m also someone who likes and thrives with self-teaching.<br><br>IMO College is <b>a bit</b> of a scam. You have lazy,  or outdated, or sadistic teachers with gigantic egos. You have a lot of classes that are not worth the financial/mental investment. It&#39;s expensive. It&#39;s stressful...<br><br>But it helps with a few things. One of them is the bane of self-teaching students of <b>any</b> area. You don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know. And if you don&#39;t know, it&#39;s hard to prioritize and to avoid pitfalls. College is <b>definitely not</b> a guarantee that you&#39;ll avoid those pitfalls, but if you&#39;re dedicated and smart, it will help you a ton.<br><br>Then, there&#39;s facilitated networking too, which is pretty invaluable.<br><br>So, it has it&#39;s pros and cons. I do wish there was a better way around it, but it is what it is."
"What disappoints me the most about the current computer science degree is that the overlap between what the industry demands and what I had to learn and do to earn this degree is very low. As a result, I have to figure out how to teach myself the full set of skills required for job hunting on top of dealing with the heavy academic workload, which is extremely hard, and almost impossible unless I were a genius or I had started very early."
"I am getting my degree even though I am full time dev.  There are some weak points that I just didn&#39;t have when learning on the job or on my own that have helped a lot.  Plus I am not the type to do projects on the side, I have other hobbies that I would rather do than write code.  Paying for school seems like moot point and waste of time, but going through Calc, Discrete Math, DSA has really made things easier even if I don&#39;t use them everyday.  It&#39;s mainly the thought process and how to approach the problem is where those college courses have come in handy.  There is also that proverbial checkbox that HR wants at times, so the degree can help with that portion.<br><br>Also what you said is true about coming to company where you are expected to learn on the fly.  I came in with a Python background and had to transition for Typescript and build a framework from scratch.  It took a month or two but I was able to know enough to get going and commit code."
"Everyone should know who that professor is. I wouldn&#39;t care if they invented time travel, a school should never hire someone like that."
"Here&#39;s the thing I&#39;ve been in the IT industry for 6 years now and I started out as help desk and ive been trying to land an egineer role but it seems like no one wants to take me in. I got 2 certifications for cloud computing and nothing as of yet. The thing I&#39;ve noticed a bit is that people with a degree seem to just walk right in and get the role while I gotta apply and still get rejected for these engineer roles and yes I have a portfolio to prove my skillset. I&#39;ve been trying to break into cloud for 2 years now and its HARD to get in. Well, at the end of it all im considering going back to university to complete my bachelors and HOPEFULLY with my already earned experince I could potentially land a senior role. So yes, finish your degree if you&#39;re in university even if its just a title but you&#39;ll be suprised what kind of roles you can actually land and even senior roles without any prior experience. GOOD LUCK!"
Imagine someone said in order to be a doctor you need to be interested and passionate and providing value for people to see for free from a teen. People would 100% say the field is cooked
"Everyone seems to only talk about code and development in compuyer science when there are so many more paths in CS that are way less saturated. There is SRE, SE, SA, DBRE, NOC, NE, and SEC. So many paths with the chance to make just as much as a dev"
"WRT Google making you re-interview, that&#39;s not really the case for returning internships. I can&#39;t speak to real conversion offers but for a returning internship your are first evaluated based on your performance in your internship, and some council decides whether you pass the bar for a return offer. <br><br>The good news is that a returning intern is way more efficient on average than an external hire, so the company is incentivised to give you the return offer as long as you did good enough because they already invested in your training in your past internship(s). The bar really isn&#39;t that high (for someone who already had to pass the interviews to get hired the first time around). If they deem you good enough, you are eligible for a return offer, and your application joins the pool of other applicants for the year who have also passed their technical interviews / been appointed by the return offer jedi council. <br><br>The bad news is that once you get approved you still have to do individual Intern Placement Interviews with potential hosts. And usually a lot more people are approved than there are positions, so many people deemed good enough to work at google simply don&#39;t get a job for headcount reasons. This process is pretty stressful, and is IMO mainly luck based. Hosts will search for keywords and try and filter the applicant pool for those who happen to have interests that align with the specific project, so you just have to hope that your cover letter mentions something that some obscure intern project is also about this year. I had no real interest in AI pre-internship, but happened to make a crappy chess bot four years ago, and so got a spot with Lens. If I hadn&#39;t been really into chess and done that random project as a high school junior then I doubt I would have gotten any offer... Now I feel kind of railroaded into AI because that&#39;s what my only work experience thus far and I figure the best way to increase my chances at an internship next year is to take advantage of my experience to outcompete other applicants, whereas if I try and pivot to a new field I&#39;ll be the one with no experience.<br><br>I sure hope the market turns around in the next two years!"
Oh..you haven&#39;t seen the dark underbelly of the University system. Its like hunger games for everyone that isn&#39;t a tenured professor. And the cycle never ends.
bro should make the bad before makingt the video
No
"Back in April, I managed to get my sys admin profession (where I live we call everything profession which is more than a cert but less than a diploma). I managed to land at a classic, L1 user support job, currently studying Azure for my Az-104 cert, then for my Az-500. I have the Az-900 already. I want to be a security engineer. Trust me, I&#39;m hella scared already on how could I transition into the security area in IT. I see tons of videos suggesting there is an IT recession and more and more companies are getting rid of employees. Any tips or tricks how could I deal with the stress? I&#39;m really not sure where I should head"
No.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=760"">12:40</a><br><br>I was actually super lucky. Landed a job in April this in cybersecurity. They trained me from nothing, no degree. Our cyber is in house so we have like literally 6 hours of downtime to study and self improve, and they budgeted 15k for certs and that&#39;s not taken out of our tuition reimbursement. Pay is a bit low, but considering my only &quot;experience&quot; was 1.5 years community college I think that&#39;s fine. Our boss did that with 10/14 of our SOC analysts. Our company promotes heavily within so the opportunities are amazing. Feels like I RNG&#39;d into the American Dream."
"No, it&#39;s not worth it: <br>* everything that could potentially be solved is already solved, <br>* anything interesting and not solvable will never be solved (NP-hard, etc),<br>* the remaining small set of solvable problems are not worth investing time because they are practically useless."
"Get the registered Nurse,,, its well paid,,"
"Something that is not said enough imo, is that SWE is not the only path for CS majors. Like said in the video, CS!= Software Engineering. You can go the Networking,Cybersecurity,IT Consultant, and other paths too that I’m not listing. <br><br>I’m not interested/ passionate enough in Software Engineering to do it, however I’m very passionate about Cybersecurity and love it (specifically red team). So I added my concentration in Cybersecurity. As Neetcode said, it’s a lot easier to study something you’re interested in so this has been a hell of a lot easier for me to study and genuinely improve and learn at. Overall, I just think people should remember that CS doesn’t automatically==SWE. Find what you like if you don’t enjoy SWE."
"Last semester CS guy, went to the best university in my country. Let&#39;s see where does this go"
ahhh hell nah i at least have like 2 more years to see if this is worth
"The only thing that I&#39;m finding to be harder than finding a job, is finding a reason to not just kill myself"
It is because all the tech job is going to India. Surprise no one is noticing
"faang honestly have terrible &quot;on-the-job training&quot; related to design/coding. For good on-the-job training, I recommend either a government job where there&#39;s enough leisure time to train you or a godsend mature medium-sized tech company that builds financial, security, or data analytics services (think SAP but smaller). These companies have very specific requirements and everyone&#39;s dedicated to those problems so they do expect new guys a certain amount of ramp-up time and there&#39;s enough bandwidth for experienced engineers to train you.<br>The only exception to this is maybe Amazon if you count their AWS certification program an &quot;on-the-job training&quot; but that would also require you to have a good manager."
"If they wanted to interview you, they think your skillset is already good enough. Beating the interviews is done by making the employer feel safe and comfortable about their decision to hire you. It&#39;s literally not based on anything else. You are not selling your skills you are selling them on a decision they are struggling to make. If a degree makes them feel safer about hiring you, then honestly why not?"
i&#39;m going into driving boats. my gf literally has a degree in mech eng and is a skipper. Fk my degree i&#39;m gonna go straight into my commercial yachtmaster idgaf
"If not CS, what else? What kind of other skills can be paired with development skills to be an attractive candidate?"
The degree also shows an ability to stick with something for more than 2 months…
"Ai ain&#39;t going to replace us, just the Web developers, and everything related to coding. We are more than just coding machines."
I am pretty sure that most degree would be useless except STEM major because companies use AI.
"theoretically, wouldn&#39;t it be easier to get hired again in the tech sector if there is an economic collapse? Since most companies are being frugal on hiring and laying off employees to keep their profits up each quarter, once everything goes to hell, the companies won&#39;t have to worry about their profits each quarter cause they&#39;ll be starting from ground zero--therefore spending more to hire more employee"
Computer science will always be worth it
"It’s not dead, people are just gonna have to start hustling like everyone else."
I think the survey : are AI perceived as a threat to your job<br><br>May have been answered by bots to say No majorly. We don&#39;t know now
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=388"">6:28</a> that does not mean the bachellors/master degree is in computer science, necessarily. All of my team (managers included) have degrees in something else..."
"I feel like these days degrees are still worth quite a bit, especially with the increased number of people trying to enter CS who come from bootcamps or are self-taught, those credentials are worthless these days and a CS degree is basically a requirement for every entry-level role.<br><br>While you can learn basically all the stuff in a CS program on your own, the real value is what school you go to and attending career fairs, networking, meeting with alumni and trying to find work that way. Also if you&#39;re trying to look for internships or a co-op, you have to be enrolled in a CS program, I learned this hard way because I didn&#39;t apply for enough internships during my time in college and now that I&#39;m a recent grad, there&#39;s very few positions open."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=845"">14:05</a> iight i&#39;m out of here. not without smashing like though."
"I&#39;m not going to follow him cause I&#39;m not a fan of the constant doom and gloom, not remotely helpful for my mental health, when I&#39;m studying for tech."
4 Years and by the time you went you will still be missing whatever technology or methodology HR scum insist you need to have to debug functions.
I really wished IT wasn’t saturated my grandma wants to even be a software developer 😂
I also think that even college students are self taught because we study only the basics in uni (atleast in my country)
"Seriously... Just stop going to college, learn how to code, and  stop buying software. The world will be a better place when these companies lose their sense of control."
There’s way more jobs that cs majors can get that aren’t swe and most cs majors don’t know that
"lol, I am a combo of Veteran, Hardend, and Regular."
"Coding isn&#39;t that cool and developers don&#39;t deserve their six figure salaries.  They make things needlessly complicated to ensure their own job security.  A bit like how prior to the printing press, scribes closely guarded the secrets of writing.  AI shows us how easy it is to make functional software."
No.
Remember when people said the same thing about Law degrees like 15 years ago
Computer science degree are still worth it for the people who doesnt do web dev/frontend
"im going to college for cs but i dont even go to most of my lectures, i just look at the assignments and learn how to complete them on my own lol"
"Te problem is seeing university as a place to learn things only. University is about networking just as much as for learning, it gives you the oportunity to network with people in your field"
"Problem with the degrees is less so about degrees teaching you anything, and it more so being the magic piece of paper that gets you past HR. Without the degree no one will even look at you."
I have BS applied math and MS CS and I’m unemployed USA citizen since birth living in Silicon Valley<br><br>My sibling has BS in communications with minor in art history<br><br>She works at MAANG making multi six figures sending chatgpt generated emails all day <br><br>What’s wrong with this world?
I survived game dev industry lay offs.<br><br>I studied music in college. I work programming. College is bullshit.
The solution that nobody wants to hear is that US citizens should be the only eligible employees for US Companies.  Getting a job in SWE wouldn’t be hard if 2.5m H-1B’s from India weren’t undercutting the salary for these positions.
Funny how there&#39;s so much FUD out there yet it&#39;s not at all being reflected into the current job market.<br>Here in the Netherlands still an incredibly high shortage in software engineers (Java and C#). I see job offer ads up for months not being able to find a candidate and all of them offer excellent salaries.
"I’m a high school junior with ~5-6 years of coding experience. Even when I went to CMU over the summer for accelerated courses, I noticed how stupid a lot of the students are (especially considering that this was a program with 15% acceptance rate). So many of them were using ChatGPT to get that far without any skill.<br><br>Sure, there were <b>some</b> really smart and passionate programmers, but a majority of them appear to have cheated to that level."
"The biggest thing is networking absolutely, for people well networked there will always be work. <br>Also on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=360"">6:00</a>, i&#39;d pick Charlie any day of the week, but i&#39;m self-taught myself so there might be a little bias 😂<br>I do objectively believe the self-taught crowd give you the biggest bang-for-buck, they usually underestimate their earning potential, they are often more skilled and more experienced even as juniors than you&#39;d expect, and they have a genuine passion for coding and tech in general which is why they started self-teaching to begin with.<br><br>Bootcampers are absolutely at the bottom of the pole, miles below the degree and the self-taught crowd, bootcamps are were you find all the people who are just in it to make money because they heard it&#39;s easy and pays well, it&#39;s where you find all the people with no genuine interest and whose entire tech experience amounts to the time they spent at the bootcamp so a few months...<br><br>The college crowd shares some of the issues from the bootcampers but it requires more effort to do the degree so if they didn&#39;t truly want it they would&#39;ve quit at some point, which gives me more confidence in them than a bootcamper"
"I wouldn&#39;t recommend going into CS rn, go into business, accounting, or something, they do just as well often times with better work life balance. None of this is because of AI but rather interest rates, current demands by shareholders to appear lean. Most importantly become a likable and social person. People will look past a temporary lack of skills if you are the type of person they want to work with, especially outside of CS. I actually got my CS job with no degree partially due to playing bass and having that in common with the interviewer, discussing bands etc. I think this is where the vast majority of people who have trouble finding white collar jobs in any industry go wrong, they forget that ultimately working is a social activity."
College = self taught with extra steps + $100k in debt
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=315"">5:15</a> is so true, ive met people in my highschool that would not want to be seen on a computer because it made them look like a person with no friends."
"you can watch better videos on youtube but without the professor you don&#39;t know which videos to use. There&#39;s so much info on the internet that without the professors lecture notes, you dont really know what to watch and what order is best"
That professor better clone himself. Hahaha
This gives me hope!
&quot;btw i love this guy&quot; isnt even subscribe to him himself lmao
"Short answer, No. there is a massive excess of talent. Companies can dictate the rules and overtime salaries will lower. Business kind of roles will be the next best paying jobs"
that professor was mean because so many students just want the research position to pad their resume.
Wonder what happened to &quot;learn to code?&quot; It should be &quot;learn to weld&quot;.
Yes or no ?
ur not even subribed yourself lol
"I hate when people say that college is a scam. Is it worth the money that you pay? No. But college itself is great. You really learn a lot. College really made me realize WHY higher levels of education is so important. You become a well rounded person. As far as computer science goes, as the video says, it gives you a DEEP understanding about technology and the way that it works. It WILL help you in a tech career. There’s this misconception that CS is just all about coding that’s peddled by the tech industry. CS is an academic discipline first and foremost. YOU want CS to be something it’s not. And it’s not an obligation that CS bends the knee to that demand."
Am I cooked for being 26 and thinking of pursuing a comp sci degree?
So basically trying to become a coder is the same as trying to become a pop star…
so i will ask my prof to do a paper with him
The dreaded McDonalds fryer beep (I’ve worked at McDonalds)
the only real answer is No.
He makes getting a fast food job seem way too easy. After all the Big Tech rejections I tried the fast food route and got rejected or ghosted there too 😅
Just put the fries in the bag lil bro.
i mean now people are forgetting for any cs job after graduation. 50k to 60k jobs for experience so yes we are cooked
boomer prof at the end lol
The best degree is yourself
"As a recent grad who had a return offer from an internship and is currently in my second year of full time, the benefits (for me) of a degree were:<br><br>- Well rounded education. With college, like anything, you get out what you put into it. I was always a good student, I did my assignments ahead of time, asked questions to professors, read the books, etc. Graduated with a 4.0 and felt like I learned a lot.<br><br>- Motivation. I am someone who struggles to self-motivate without external pressure / deadlines. Without homework assignments being due and grades, I would never have gotten around to studying all the things I did in school. If you have very high self-motivation, this may not be an issue, but for me college was very beneficial in that it motivated me to work and do projects.<br><br>- Internships. I got my internship for the summer after my junior year. I actually didn&#39;t have much difficulty landing it. I believe I got an interview because I had a high GPA and was taking classes beneficial to the position (Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems). This internship ended up giving me a return offer, and I am currently still working at this company 1.5 years later.<br><br>- Networking. I met a lot of other students who I still have in my LinkedIn network, and who I reach out to from time to time. They can be a way to get your foot in the door. I also met professors. With any school, there are good and bad professors, but I formed relationships with the good ones, and learned a lot from their experience.<br><br>- People skills. Finally, I met a lot of friends in college. This may seem silly but I matured a lot in college, and interacting with a large group of new people and making friends is great for your social skills. Lots of people in CS like to code alone in their room, and I was one of them in high school. But I learned a lot about talking to people during college which made networking and interviews much easier. I think this is an often-overlooked benefit of going to school.<br><br>Is a degree necessary? No. But while it is common nowadays for people (especially in CS) to say degrees are useless, I still believe they are the simplest and easiest path to a successful career. And community college can often get you half of your degree for free or very cheap."
The recruit difficulty doesn&#39;t exist. That person wouldn&#39;t have to work
"It’s easy to look back at a CS degree and feel like you could have learned everything yourself. However, people forget that our high school system promotes a lot of memorization and doesn’t teach most students how to learn things efficiently. You’re going to college to learn how to learn and being provided with a curriculum to follow. It’s going to be a much easier path with a CS degree and if you went the self taught route it’s going to be very difficult unless you are one of those people that knew how to learn things out of high school. In that case you were gonna be successful no matter what you do."
To Everyone else: YOU SATURATED THE MARKET DAMN YOU ONLY I AM WORTHY FOR A PROGRAMMING JOB
"I have a CS degree from a okay school and I do think it helps like 35%, networking is much higher"
"Ah yes, the 18 year olds who have been coding since highschool, 6 months ago."
Well is independent in the economy you are in tech stocks simply don&#39;t perform well in high inflation and interest rates
Well this ain’t making me feel any better 🤓
"Besides getting my first job, I think the best thing college / my CS degree did for me was teach me how to learn things on my own.. particularly in my senior level classes.. but to NeetCode’s point, i went to school with people who cheated everything and generally didn’t know basic things like what a constructor for a class was; I truly believe that the degree doesn’t make you; however, it DEFINITELY can enhance you if you use it the right way.<br><br>It all depends on your own motivation as an individual. I just happen to be someone who generally loves software engineering."
"Here’s my advice after almost 20 years in the field: take some free classes online (if you’re reading this you have access to free education), work on some practical projects, build a portfolio on github, apply for internships or entry level jobs, if you don’t succeed at least you didn’t fail AND be in student loan debt."
Schools and certifiers profit off failure. YouTube educators rely on a good reputation to teach well or they don’t profit. That’s the difference that makes YouTube better than schooling
i tried to click on your yt notifications. three times 🥲🥲🥲
we have a mandatory software class for seniors and they teach us git and unit testing
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=228"">3:48</a> Luck doesn&#39;t exist. Every little thing has a meaning to it. Lol."
"I got my CS bachelor a couple months ago but still working as a mechanic, after work I would work on projects as a hobby until I get good enough as a developer to apply to jobs."
as a new grad with previous work experience and personal projects i am on the verge of unaliving myself
"Every single one of these opinions is just that. Opinions. I&#39;ve come to appreciate we don&#39;t know anything about anything, especially when it comes down to general competance, let alone what general knowledge is. I&#39;m self taught and am very familiar with DSA, mathematics, and more, and I disagree with the general notion of what is clearly misconstrued as &quot;self taught&quot;. People say this, but very few truly understand what that entails, let alone what it really means. This means looking up course materials, buying books on your own, self studying pedagogical materials by yourself with no safety net, backup, networking, or accredidation, and then applying it all in real world practical applications. The majority of people are just not that motivated and don&#39;t even know where to start. Imagine doing it all completely by yourself on your own dime in whatever little spare time you can find. Its not something I&#39;d recommend to anyone and it&#39;s the most difficult thing I&#39;ve ever done in my life. It&#39;s lonely and it sucks and I did it this way because I had no other option. If you can, go to school. Get your degree. Dont be a dumbass. A degree is a social proof way of saying, I did this. Thats it. Nothing more, nothing less. School is truly unnecessary and is too expensive and the only value it has - is social proofing. Its so stupid."
My ears got cancer from the audio.
"yo, nothing wrong with pink. that sweater is sick"
"people in the past are optimisitcs because everything helps, now information overwhelm, people are now saying things are bad AFTER they have done it. Most of the important life decisions are never black nor white, it is mostly grey, there are always pros and cons. it is up to YOU, the person in your brain, to make that decision yourself. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t trust anyone who backtrack and then say they can do this by themselves when they never get another chance to start young and test it out if they can actually do this by themselves. it is a very common fallacy, people keep talking about how they can invent twitter, build apple, create google but there is no one but only sergey and larry and one steve jobs. Think about it."
"People doing everything in their power to NOT read books. Books / texts have been a phenomenal learning tool for centuries. I tried watching and learning Python through a $30 course. Nothing stuck. Tried watching Dr. Chuck Severance&#39;s PY4E course on Youtube. Some stuff stuck but once we got into harder concepts, nothing stuck. <br><br>Reading a book on Python that has coding exercises for you to follow along has been crucial in my learning experience. If I go to bed and forget something the next day, I don&#39;t have to rewind a video to find the sentence that ties everything together. With books, if you forget something, you can turn back 1 or 2 pages, relearn what you forgot, program, and move on.<br><br>READ BOOKS ON YOUR LANGUAGE OF CHOICE, MAKE SURE IT HAS EXERCISES TO FOLLOW ALONG, AND PROGRAM PEOPLE!!!"
What about computing enginnering?
"Higher education is important, just sucks it costs so much"
"Personal story, I literally self taught myself by reading &quot;learn python the hard way&quot; the summer after completing my 2nd year of an I.T degree where I focused on business analysis and networking. Final year I took 3rd year programming courses and suffered immensely to the point where I had no life at all for that year but I got through it. I was working as a security guard and strangely converted that into a final year project where I made a scheduling system for them. From there I worked for them a bit more and got into a crappy company and worked my way up switching jobs."
"You actually need soft skills to talk to clients now. No more sitting at your desk and scoffing at other departments, no more making every conversation about your own interests."
"This attitude is why we have react / js bootcamp script kiddies crying about not having work and flooding job postings<br><br>That being said this whole issue gets confused with &quot;does college get you a job&quot; vs &quot;do you learn in college&quot; No, college does not guarantee you a job.  If you  believe that you&#39;re as stupid as the people that told you. And no, ignorance is an explanation and not an excuse."
"I think one of the greatest benefits of a CS degree, is the problem solving skills that you develop. <br>    Knowing the techniques and understanding how to break down and solve extremely complex problems is one of the most valuable skills you can acquire.<br>    Further, the academic requirements of a CS degree go a long way in terms of weeding out those who are exceptional from those who are at or below average."
"I was done with college two years on, and before that I was only spending 20 hours per subject, so around 100 per semester (that sounds like way too high actually, maybe more like 50).<br><br>The whole fundamentals thing is more cringe every time I hear it. These fundamentals are so simple they are no different than learning other non funamental thing when you need it, if you need it. And don&#39;t get me started on people who think they know the fundamentals bbecause can dereference a pointer in C"
"Hey bro. You mentioned you could probably have learned the most important stuff you learned from college in about a year if you were studying on your own. Could you possibly make a video were you explore how you would go about doing that now?<br>Like how you you would stucture your own program, what topics, what order to follow when learning them, stuff like that. I think that would be not only really interesting, but also really helpful for anyone trying to learn on their own."
"I&#39;ve been in the field for 23 yrs and been hiring for last 15 years.  Degrees are meaningless to me.  My best hires are the guys who self taught and kept up with technology.  Either way, I&#39;m going to watch you code and I&#39;m going to make an offer based on how well you know your stuff and how much hand-holding you&#39;ll need from my existing team."
"As a recent cs graduate, I do feel this. Honestly that part where you mentioned learning to stuff that YOU are interested in is something that I really wish I leaned harder into. Ive been very up and down with it because conflict of interests with school and personal projects. It sucks right now and I hope it gets better."
lol
"no, is simple coding is over"
Short answer from a furry from Poland that found a job after year of personal projects console apps in C++<br>three months of projects made specially to look good on github so GUI C# business related lookingish<br>and then three months of interviews: No

I&#39;ve learned so much more off of YouTube than I have at school
"As someone who majored in Maths (Actuarial Science precisely) and later on pivoted to Computer Science as my minor, Computer Science is the safest major one can pursue in college. Today, becoming a computer scientist doesn&#39;t require a formal education, considering how CS knowledge is decentralised.<br><br>But, forget about the hype of the self-taught culture being pushed down your throats by content creators. Sure, in one way or another, all CS students are self-taught, considering how much of college studies are theoretical.<br><br>However, the current tech job market is unforgiving to everyone, but more unforgiving to self-taught engineers with no college degrees. <br><br>From what I&#39;ve heard recruiters/ex-recruiters say, especially here on YouTube, they&#39;ll always prioritize candidates with college degrees over those that don&#39;t have one. <br><br>So, for future proofing your career and advancing it, consider getting a college degree, it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be a CS degree but atleast, a STEM course speciality if you want to be a well rounded engineer. <br><br>In as much as college degrees are trashed in the current tech job market, having a degree will always be the best investment one can do for themselves."
"The stuff like CPU architecture, compiler algorithms, operating systems, and networking was absolutely mind-blowing and super captivating in my studies. I cannot by any means relate to the boredom the author of the original video describes<br><br>[EDIT]: I came to Germany specifically to get my CS degree with no tuition fees. Yes, education in Germany is free."
people cheat like crazy in that institutional learning
"Computer science degrees are <b>NOT</b> exclusively for SWE roles. If all you want is an easy SWE role, then don&#39;t do it."
"It&#39;s surprising to learn that in the US, you often don&#39;t need to write a substantial scientific paper to earn a Bachelor&#39;s degree, and in some cases, even for a Master&#39;s degree. In contrast, I spent around 150 hours working on my Bachelor&#39;s degree project in IT engineering, and then another 150 hours writing my thesis, which incorporated references to about 20 other scientific works. The whole point of higher education in Poland is to produce a final scientific work."
If you read this you&#39;re a doomer. Prove me wrong
"Recently i dropped out of university. After 1 year i couldn&#39;t make sense of it anymore. I wasn&#39;t productive anymore, i wasn&#39;t learning as i used to be. It felt a Total waste of money time and energy. Instead I&#39;m trying to follow the same path as university but without certificate"
A community college degree is going to be worth more than any universities degrees bc of the time 🙄. <br><br>Universities are planning to make their degrees three years to finished than the four years program
"It&#39;s crazy how people think AI is peak computer science. LOL. It&#39;s just the beginning of interesting computer science, it&#39;s barely getting started!"
I wonder how much will that threat metric change because of openAI&#39;s o1 model.
"Tbh this professor may be not super nice but I bet it works for him. From his perspective he might have had a lot of slacking students that were wasting his time, by sending this message he filters them and only keeps those that are motivated enough. The question is wheter he is dick when it comes to interacting with people that work in his lab."
"Why don&#39;t people speak about Codecademy&#39;s Computer Science path, that path is pretty solid when it comes to Computer Science theory"
The FUD on YT is crushing me.  So much so that I&#39;m ready to give up 1 year into this mid-life career shift and go back to my former life in aviation.
"Sir , could you make a video on unit testing?"
I’m taking cyber security
"Let me give some nuance to the other side as someone who have worked in the industry for more than 10 years. There are two branches in IT (which people don&#39;t seem to talk about), you have the developers and you have infrastructure - meaning your code needs to run somewhere and the network needs to be in place, aka we deal with systems design all day long. As a senior architect in infra, we cannot find talented people. It is almost impossible and the job market is insane. Unfortunately, there are no college degrees to be a &quot;FAANG architect&quot; like there is in SWE.  But if you want a high paying job, look into that. For example, have a look at Cisco CCIE certification, which is notorious hard to get and then google salaries for a network architect with that certification. Maybe you&#39;ll be surprised."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=528"">8:48</a> &quot;In computer science, you don&#39;t really get to build cool stuff&quot; ... lol yeah. Literally laying the foundation for the information age: not cool. The next enterprise CRUD app: hella cool!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=1149"">19:09</a> Why is the professor&#39;s name blurred out?  If he&#39;s going to shame his volunteers, we should be able to shame him."
"Bootcamps get a bit of an unfairly bad rap imo. As someone who both graduated college and a coding bootcamp, I learned a lot more practical knowledge from the bootcamp that I did in an equivalent time in college. Yes I was a more dedicated and focused during that time, but even still the curriculum was just more practical and more focused around projects. Now when they suggest (implicitly or otherwise) that you’ll sail to a 6-figure job after the bootcamp with nothing else on your resume, that’s when I think the bad rap is earned."
"People who study computer science not because it&#39;s fundamental and is a key to defining the foundations of mathematics, but simply to get a job or something equally dumb do not deserve any sympathy."
"Full agree on the self-taught. Imho, most of academic success is pretty much a function of you learning to put your time to good use and make do with your resources on your own. University almost is more about teaching that notion to students than individual courses - which of course are still a huge part of it. I mean, not really necessarily for Bachelor&#39;s degrees, more for postgrad tbh."

"Just to clear a point about &quot;you can work without degree&quot;, that&#39;s extremely difficult, even though if you found a job, the salary will be cut off by like 10%-30%, that&#39;s why the recruiter hired you specially, because they can cut off the salary without you negotiating about it, because you&#39;re already struggling to find a job. I work in non-tech industry, as a SE student, however my salary is being cut off by 50% because I don&#39;t have a degree in the field I&#39;m working on, even though it doesn&#39;t really need a degree."

The problem is developers are blinded by abstraction just too much abstraction (js libraries and stuff) that they will never understand how things work internally, I play with low level stuff on a daily basis. Knowing some libraries will make you replaceable with AI."
"I feel like the major benefit of a degree is your prospective employer has evidence that you have the minimum self discipline to follow through on a semi long term goal, which is pretty good to know. It doesn&#39;t say much about your actual skill level but it&#39;s a good start."
The arts grads are frothing with vindication that the advice of doing a stem degree wasn&#39;t a fool proof way to a job.
"I don&#39;t know if university can be called a &#39;scam&#39;. I think the better way to put it is that we scammed ourselves with the belief that uni can get us good jobs. That is assuming that american univ does not actively advertises themselves as a precious stepping stool for a good job. Every step of the way in university, it&#39;s clearly designed to get students further into academics, especially the sciences degrees. None of the material taught in univ concerns itself on what happens in the job market.<br><br>It&#39;s just that somehow the masses believes that having a degree means having a key to a good job. It&#39;s not just CS. This is practically for every job out there. The belief is reinforced by recruiters preferring applicants with a degree.<br><br>In my country, there&#39;s such a thing as trade schools for software engineering. These schools are basically HS equivalent. They taught you trade skills on top of what they should&#39;ve learned for HS. I am floored by what they can do in SWE classes. They basically outmatched everyone with CS degree in my country. The thing is, trade school diplomas are not prestigious, recruiters still prefers bachelors degree for their applicants. This is changing now, at least in my company. We don&#39;t pay too much attention to degrees. We have a lot of trade school graduates working in our company while attending college to round out their educations, and these employees are the brightest of the bunch."

But for a lot of other people (in my class &amp; otherwise), it&#39;s tough.<br><br>I still love programming &amp; building things -- whether it&#39;s ML, computer vision, or just fun/helpful websites. I really valued my education and felt like it gave me a great base of knowledge. But -- frankly -- I have zero desire to do Leetcode.

It&#39;s that simple. Recruiting feels a bit backward -- I just wish there were more open-ended interview options than pure Leetcode monkey.

"That comment around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=695"">11:35</a> really hit home because on one hand I had a professor who I swear to god was the BEST teacher to teach automata theory to a guy like me who hears the words &quot;Let&#39;s say...&quot; and my brain shuts off. I suck at theories but managed to pass the class with a B but on the other hand, I had professor who was the absolute worse for teaching algorithms. The worst part is that I LOVE algorithms but all he did was read off a powerpoint and sometimes he seemed confused. How the fuck I come into a class I PAID for and learn LESS than I could have just going to youtube?"
"Your point about being genuinely skilled at what you do is something that I agree with a lot. If you<br><br>- Genuinely give a shit about the field and aren&#39;t just doing it for the money<br>- Are better than 90% of your peers<br><br>then you&#39;ll do okay. Admittedly this isn&#39;t the best <i>advice</i> since by definition it can&#39;t apply to 90% of people, but if you feel like you fall into that group, then maybe you shouldn&#39;t worry as much. But here we all are, watching YouTube videos about our field in our leisure time. That&#39;s probably a leg up."
computer engineering is where its at
"...you&#39;re an idiot if you think a computer science degree is useless.  I mentored somebody at my job through their internship to their hired position who has one and we both make six figures.  I have a computer engineering degree which is a proxy but quite a bit different.<br>All this scaring people out of going to school needs to end.

If you want to be a lazy bum and excuse yourself by joining the choir of &quot;school is worthless&quot;, be my guest.  My salary isn&#39;t suffering from it."
"The best thing from uni imo are tests and exams. Hot take, but if you&#39;re self studying the hardest part is making sure you are learning the subject correctly and that you remembered the information. Best way to do that is through exams and tests, which aren&#39;t easy to find in online resources."
"If computer science degrees become “useless” due to AI then every other degree will have the same faith. I’ll keep studying CS, because I love this and a bonus is that I’ll actually understand the mechanics behind AI!"

I just enrolled in Full Sail for the accel Bach. in CS and I could not be more excited.  Be the contrarian. Be the dedicated. Be the hard worker, for yourself, if nothing else. Be a better you."
"Im self taught, but then i couldnt get any interviews. so I went and got my degree. speed ran the degree cuz I already knew the material from being self taught, now the employers will talk to me even though I didn&#39;t really learn much from college.

Good day.&quot;"
"Something people forget on the self-taught side is that it isn&#39;t a matter of whether you can find that knowledge out in the world and learn it, the problem is whether you will bother to do it.  Learning on a need-to-know basis sounds great, but you have the issue of unknown unknowns, but also you are ceding the field to others who already know things.  I noticed this frequently over my career, you&#39;d have a collection of people trying to brainstorm a solution to a problem, and the way to get remembered was to have an actionable plan of action on the spot that you could flesh out without having to go off and research for 3 weeks (and this is even ignoring the fact that sometimes you don&#39;t have three weeks to get started on the problem).<br><br>Additionally, as a smart and motivated self-taught programmer, your real competition isn&#39;t CS majors who cheated their way to a good grade, you are competing against smart and motivated people who majored in CS.  If you really just want to bang out some code for a random insurance company, that&#39;s fine, but if you want to work at a FAANG, your best bet is to level up on every front available to you.<br><br>All of that said, I will also wholeheartedly agree that a lot of the benefit of a formal degree is spending those years embedded in a learning system.  Like maybe you&#39;ll have a few profs who really aren&#39;t delivering a ton of value, but then you&#39;ll have one that gets you a great project with a presentation slot at a conference, or who connects you up with a good internship.  Or you&#39;ll have older friends who connect you up with employment.  It&#39;s a competitive environment, but at least nominally they are there to help you to the next level."

"One reason degree is bad coz a lot of what you learn was learned on 12 hours before Exam day. My honest advice is if you don&#39;t like coding and not really passionate about making stuff then may be reconsider your choice. I get that some take it just for money, but not only this kills them emotinally but also the bad quality of code frustates others also. I am taking about 2000 LoC in a single function 🥹"

"Prof here. Some of the stuff said in the video was incorrect about universities and profs (although some stuff was very accurate). I would love to be on your show and talk more about how universities operate. People don&#39;t understand the restraints we are under nor the impossible task we have when attempting to get you ready for industry in 4 short years. Is it perfect? No, but many solutions that seem obvious at first really don&#39;t work in practice. Anyway, I would love to do an interview with you if you are up to it."

"Every startup. entrepreneur will say you don&#39;t need a CS degree but they either got their faang job because of CS degree or will hire only CS Master&#39;s and PhD&#39;s to work on their new world changing products and if they hire self-taught engineers it will be with decades of proven experience in a very specific area. That should tell you what is valued and what is not. As a self taught and trained on the job, software engineer and someone who almost got a CS degree I will say having a CS degree will open up lot of doors that you can&#39;t even imagine. With a CS degree you will think like a CS engineer but without one it all depends on factors such as your knowledge exposure, location to a tech hub, getting right opportunities at right time and connections and so on. IMO, It is the hard reality."
"Comp Sci still worth it if you&#39;re really passionate about it. It no longer guarantees you a job like it did 15-20 years ago. I could care less about coding outside of my 9-5.Never did an internship and no side/personal projects, just graduated  straight into a job. If I was a fresh grad these days I would be unemployed lmao."
It&#39;s arguable if traditional CS was ever teaching you much that was worthwhile - and now it&#39;ll be even more of a waste of 4 years than before.
You surely like mentioning you working at google😂
It also depends wether visa sponsorship is needed or not. Companies are doing away with visa sponsorship nowadays
Summary of the video: Short Answer - Yes. Long answer: Yes.
"I’ve done both. I started self-taught and did get work, but I always felt left out since many people around me had degrees. I also feel being self-taught makes you focused on getting something working, which while a valuable skill, it’s easy to miss a lot of non-obvious stuff that is important.  I decided to get a degree after being self-taught and working in the industry for 12 years, and I’m glad I did. It wasn’t all great, a lot of it I already knew, there was still a large self-taught aspect, but it made me a much more well-rounded programmer. I feel I have a broader perspective and deeper understanding that even if not applied directly to a task informs the way I approach things and my awareness of potential pitfalls. Finally, there are some doors that really aren’t open to you without a degree. So, while you can get a job self-taught, it just makes things more difficult for you. And yes, as some people say, you could save a lot of money locking away at home for 4 years, but you’d be missing out on structure, wisdom from experience, community, and university is fun! Especially being Canadian where you can get zero interest student loans, it is easily worth it."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=341"">5:41</a> My personal anecdote, I didn’t even major in computer science. I majored in information systems. I got a full time job as a software engineer only a month after graduating this year. I made sure to send 10 job applications a day and I attended in person networking events. That’s the recipe"
"As a cs grad, don&#39;t do it."
"I have a master&#39;s degree, I wouldn&#39;t recommend getting a degree. Just teach your kid Computer Architecture, Operating Systems then make him read CLRS and grind LeetCode/Codeforces. He&#39;ll be CEO of a mutli-mlllion $ startup by 15."
"What I also like about a CS degree is that it also exposes you to different kinds of tech that you might find interesting - systems/OS/graphics/Information Retrieval, etc. The courses provide structure and bouncing your ideas/thoughts off your peers definitely helps over just going to YouTube and monotonously going thru a course. And frankly, it pushes you to be social which is so so SO important - you want that promotion, you need to communicate lol You need to develop that clout/influence and how do you develop that? Communication!! Even when your job is purely technical in nature!!<br><br>And frankly, a CS/any degree exposes you a certain kind of rigour which helps your grow/manage yourself. Idk why the hate, man - yes, everything&#39;s online but there&#39;s a reason everyone still prefers to go to college (not to mention, the NETWORK you develop!) if they can.<br><br>So if you can, GO TO COLLEGE!!!<br><br>Also, yay, thanks for wearing pink lol 🦾"
My problem with degrees and stuff is they are truly over valued for what is actually provided. Most professors nowadays could be replaced with a well formatted lesson plan and book recommendations.
I just got my 2 year degree for programming at 34. 3 interviews over the last year. This is gonna be interesting 😂😅
"i got into coding sophomore year i learnt game hacking (c/c++, reverse engineering and creating kernel drivers ), python c#, yet i cant get a single job this is some bullshit.

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=699"">11:39</a> EXACTLY😂 everyone i talk to says they just watched a youtube video to understand something"
it’s gotten to a point where a masters degree in cs is now the new normal
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=364"">6:04</a> same with my school. i go to a local school and i would not know how to code just following the curriculum. a cs degree is mostly theory and depending on the school, will offer useful classes like web development with the popular tech used in the industry. and my school got the audacity to assign a senior project😂 most of my classmates don’t even know what they are doing cuz they didn’t teach themselves 😂 most of the useful skills i learned came from youtube"
"I think if you are self taught or went to a bootcamp then cool, another thing that is stated is &quot;got a job without a degree.&quot; I think its important to call out that a lot of self taught or bootcamp graduates do have a degree, just not a Computer Science degree. I did go to college and in my experience the other Engineers that I work with who did go to college are better Software Engineers as a whole because being a good SWE is more than just knowing how to solve a leetcode question. Just because you know how to code does not mean you are a good Software Engineer. I think whether or not someone agrees with college. I still view it as a rite of passage of sorts, like you did your little 4 years got your degree and moved on the the next level."
"It depends. A degree is a prerequisite for industries like govtech and the defense industry. It&#39;s also a way to get your foot in the door for most companies since a degree (typically) holds more weight than a bootcamp cert. <br><br>But a degree does not guarantee a job and you need to do a lot of learning aside with your CS degree. Please leverage any networking, research, and internship opportunites at your college. It&#39;ll save your ass later on."
"NOW, a cs degree is useless. People are so desperate just to even find an internship. It’s too competitive now cuz everyone is doing it and everyone has the same skills and can learn it on youtube. only reason i got an internship is from a connection. i’m not better than anyone else and i’m just a random cs student"
"The college I went to grilled the CS students, you had to learn how to code or fail"
"Learn a trade just in case you’re not hired. Still do tech, but make sure you have an out incase you get too much “unfortunately we decided…..”"
Any tutorials on how to make google 2?

"the last teacher has a point though, most are NPCs checking boxes,"
"A CS degree is essentially being used as a filter. Hiring teams are being flooded with so many horrible applicants, to ease the process many will simply throw out your resume if you don’t meet the CS degree criteria. Unfortunately, that means talented devs are being tossed out. Your chances of getting a job is reduced significantly without the degree, regardless of your skill level. That’s the harsh reality, not impossible but improbable for most."
"One thing i do hate about CS in and other like technical fields in general, is that the  force us to learn, remember all the bespoke algorithm,  but never show us how we can actually come up with those kind of algorithms. Take A* for example, all they teach is how to do it, remember it, they never taught us how to actually understand why the author actually come up with that algorithm."
"However, without a degree you can&#39;t get a job in any Asian country, heck people are going for masters nowadays. The frustration in this  video is hard felt personally myself (graduated 2 years ago)."
i hate networking<br>it has nothing to do with coding
"One good thing about having formal education is that you get to meet other students( in the same boat ) and if you&#39;re careful about who you spend your time with, you can actually build a decent network of smart people who share the same goal. You DON&#39;T have to do this completely alone. It&#39;s just not the same as making a post on reddit/twitter asking for study buddies or walking up to every person in a coffee shop."
"Honestly bros, go be a public worker cop fireman or some other job, it’s way easier and you get paid as well as a junior or mid level engineer with out all the hassle of learning new tech or creating projects etc. honestly unless you are working at a faang company and making mid 400-500k it’s not worth it❤"
"If you’re gonna get a degree, do it with a college that provides life time career fair.<br><br>My university offers priority to alumni at in person career fair"
The reality is we don&#39;t know yet.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=633"">10:33</a> spot on you have to learn new things and being well rounded helps but sucks when you’re having to learn new hard stuff"

Absolutely people copying code and cheating on tests😂
"No, do a boot camp and do projects. No one cares about the degree. Unless recruiters are absolutely hard for it on your resume"
People that genuinely study and are that good wouldn&#39;t have any issues getting a CS degree.
It&#39;s not worth it. Period. Y? AI.

"Is more useful today then ever, at least the scientific approach to problem solving is the best"
I went through a TON of training at my first job. Literally gave us a bootcamp coming in (if you&#39;re a junior)
"I finished my CS degree over the summer. My Software Engineering professor literally made us learn agile/scrum from a YT playlist. 😮‍💨Now I will say this in favor of schools, if it wasnt for having a deadline and exams those videos would still be in my watch later playlist. I think my personality is more in line with the twitter kids. Leetcode/problem solving is fun but I have even more fun making the stuff."
summary: no

Neetcode&#39;s review videos. What a life. Dream came true.
Me reading the title as i study for my extremely demanding masters degree in CSE 💀
"I am self taught was able to break in, can be done."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=768"">12:48</a> In todays&#39; busy schedule, on the job training means that you learn while struggling through your day to day job. It is not a scheduke learning time anymore. Think on what you learned when you asked that staff engineer to help you solve the problem, that is your on the job training. 😬"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNq5pf5dLzQ&amp;t=714"">11:54</a> I disagree. I think bootcamp (depending on the source) are a good starting point. I started my software engineering carreer 1.5 years ago with a gootcamp. Now I am on my second year of my CS degree and the basic I learned in the bootcamp make the class clic in. I get a lot of &quot;oh that os ehat that mean&quot; or &quot;now I get why it worked like that&quot;. The a bootcamp give me a good foundation to start your computer science journey. Now, if you only go to a bootcamp and use thay as you main source of knowledge; i think that is a problem."
I took a shot everytime he said google and unmmm anddfmf/.d/.../.....
The job market is only bad for ppl who take the default path (web dev). If you actually spend a lot of time learning a specialized part of CS (like embedded) you realize there is barely any competition because 90% of new grads shit the bed if it&#39;s not leetcode and javascript
I love this channel so much. 👊
"People just don&#39;t realize that education itself is a profession. I am from Taiwan, I have been to MSU(only for a short period though) and from what I saw, there aren&#39;t that many differences. In both places professor really struggles between teaching and researching. In Academic your publication IS your currency, university hires professors based on the metric of publication and reseach experience, not educational performance. So of course some professors are just not good at teaching."
No its not. Not anymore. Started my degree before the llm hype. What a huge waste of my time.
&gt;given a female population fem of size n find a girlfriend<br>hardest leetcode question i have ever seen
Im playing on hardened lmao
"I&#39;m a woodworker and a metalworker who&#39;s recently started self teaching programming. I have been bombarded with videos of why right now is the worst possible time to get into this stuff. Unfortunately for them, I love this stuff!"
"before covid, generally it&#39;s easier to get a job, unless you applied for big tech companies. I remember back then I applied randomly, and got many calls. nowadays, I do the same thing but what I&#39;m getting mostly are &quot;unfortunately&quot; e-mails, lol"
"If computer science degrees end up useless, I don’t even know what I’ll do with my philosophy degree…."
Love the coding sloth!
I think we still have a chance
damn he’s consistent
AYEEE You uploaded
"I&#39;m starting my MSc Computer Science &amp; Software Engineering with extra modules in maths. I&#39;m already working as a mid level engineer and get paid well, didn&#39;t get a degree and did a bootcamp/self taught. Doing the degree because I have some hardcore learning/career goals looking to develop my math/cryptography with applications in software dev and have a very strong thirst for knowledge so in my case a degree makes sense."
Lol... First i guess...
